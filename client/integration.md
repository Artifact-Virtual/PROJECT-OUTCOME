Integration Paper for the Program
1. Overview
This program is designed as an online strategy game featuring alliances, territory control, real-time communication, and a trading system. It utilizes modern web technologies and integrates with a PostgreSQL database for data management.

2. Architecture Components
Frontend
Framework: React with TypeScript & Vite
Routing: Wouter for client-side routing
State Management: TanStack Query
Real-time Features: WebSocket for live updates
Styling: Tailwind CSS with a custom theme
Backend
Server Framework: Node.js with Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL managed via Drizzle ORM
Core Services:
Battle Engine: Calculates power and outcomes of battles
Marketplace: Handles trading of items
Courier Service: Manages offline transaction encoding/decoding

Database Schema
Key tables in the PostgreSQL database include:
Users: Store user information
Alliances: Manage alliances including members and territories
Marketplaces: Listings for items being sold
Messages: Communication between users
User Interaction:
Users interact with the frontend through a React interface.
API Endpoints:
The backend exposes various endpoints (trading, battle events, user messages) that handle requests from the frontend and communicate with the database.
Example endpoints include:
POST /api/battle - submits battle requests
Database Management:

WebSocket connections are established to provide real-time data updates, such as battle outcomes or territory changes to all users.
