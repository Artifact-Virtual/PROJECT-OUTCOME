## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### Option 1: Proxy Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Deploy with upgradeable proxies
npm run deploy:proxy

# This will deploy:
# 1. IdentitySBT as UUPS proxy
# 2. Eligibility as UUPS proxy
# 3. OCSH main contract
# 4. Configure roles and permissions
# 5. Run basic functionality tests
```

### Option 2: Traditional Deployment
```bash
# Deploy without proxies
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### Option 3: Custom Network
```bash
# Deploy to specific network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-proxy.js --network baseSepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-proxy.js --network sepolia
```

---

## 🔧 **ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Private Key (required)
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478c3a526db38f019c3c66b2c54

# RPC URLs (choose your network)
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

# Block Explorer API Keys (for verification)
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_key
```

---

## 📊 **EXPECTED GAS COSTS**

### Base Sepolia (Testnet)
- **Total**: ~14.7M gas
- **Cost**: ~$2-5 USD (current gas prices)
- **Time**: ~2-3 minutes

### Base Mainnet
- **Total**: ~14.7M gas
- **Cost**: ~$50-100 USD (current gas prices)
- **Time**: ~1-2 minutes

---

## 🔍 **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### 1. Contract Addresses
After deployment, you'll receive:
```
IdentitySBT (Proxy): 0x...
Eligibility (Proxy): 0x...
OCSH Game: 0x...
```

### 2. Verification on Block Explorer
```bash
# Verify contracts
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <IDENTITY_SBT_ADDRESS>
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <ELIGIBILITY_ADDRESS>
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia <OCSH_ADDRESS>
```

### 3. Basic Functionality Test
The deployment script automatically runs:
- ✅ NFT minting test
- ✅ SBT role issuance test
- ✅ Basic game functionality

---

## 🔄 **UPGRADE PREPARATION**

### For Future Upgrades
```bash
# Set proxy addresses
export IDENTITY_SBT_PROXY=0x...
export ELIGIBILITY_PROXY=0x...

# Upgrade contracts
npm run upgrade:proxy
```

### Upgrade Safety Features
- ✅ UUPS proxy pattern
- ✅ Admin-only upgrades
- ✅ Timelock protection
- ✅ Emergency pause
- ✅ Multi-sig requirements

---

## 🌐 **NETWORK OPTIONS**

### Recommended for Testing
- **Base Sepolia**: Fast, cheap, reliable
- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Standard testnet

### For Production
- **Base Mainnet**: Low gas costs, fast transactions
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Maximum security, established network

---

## 📞 **DEPLOYMENT SUPPORT**

### If You Need Help
1. **Check the logs**: All deployment steps are logged
2. **Verify gas**: Ensure sufficient funds for deployment
3. **Check network**: Confirm RPC URL is working
4. **Contact support**: dev@artifactvirtual.com

### Emergency Procedures
- **Failed deployment**: Check gas limits and balances
