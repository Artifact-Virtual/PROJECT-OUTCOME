# OCSH NFT Game - Hybrid Web3 Gaming dApp

A decentralized gaming platform implementing hybrid deployment architecture for the OCSH (On-Chain Survival Handbook) NFT collection. Built with React, TypeScript, and Wagmi v2, featuring multi-chain smart contracts and redundant hosting strategies.

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Deployment Strategy
- **Primary**: IPFS + IPNS (decentralized, censorship-resistant)
- **Secondary**: Vercel/Netlify (performance, reliability)
- **Domain**: ENS integration (ocsh.eth [U+2192] IPFS hash)
- **Fallback**: Multi-gateway IPFS access

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- **Primary Chain**: Base Network (optimized transaction fees)
- **Expansion**: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon
- **Pattern**: Proxy contracts for upgradeability
- **Security**: Multi-signature controls, emergency pause

### Data Distribution
- **On-Chain**: Critical game state (levels, ownership, battles)
- **IPFS**: Metadata, assets, detailed history
- **Traditional**: Real-time UI state, analytics

### Core Game Mechanics

**Battle System**
- Challenge other players to strategic combat
- Victory rewards: +100 XP, reputation boost, territory advantages  
- Defeat consolation: +25 XP, learning experience
- Battle outcomes determine leaderboard positions

**Alliance Formation** 
- Create and manage alliances with role-based permissions
- **Leader**: Full control over alliance operations
- **Member**: Standard battle and messaging permissions
- **Invited**: Pending acceptance status
- Alliance-exclusive messaging and coordinated strategies

**Territory Control**
- Claim and defend territories for 24-hour periods
- Strategic positioning for battle advantages
- Alliance coordination points for group strategies
- Prestige and reputation system based on territory history

**On-Chain Messaging**
- Permanent message storage on blockchain
- Anti-spam fee structure: `baseFee x 1.1^messageCount`
- 1-minute cooldown between messages
- Global and alliance-specific messaging channels

**NFT Trading & Economics**
- Direct player-to-player trading system
- Value factors: Level, XP, battle record, territory control history
- Marketplace integration for price discovery
- Smart contract-secured transactions

## [U+D83C][U+DFAE] Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### XP and Leveling System

**[U+D83D][U+DCC8] XP Calculation**
```typescript
// Battle Rewards
const victoryXP = 100;
const defeatXP = 25;

// Level Formula
const level = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(totalXP / 100)) + 1;

// XP Required for Next Level
const xpForNextLevel = (level ** 2) * 100;
```

**[U+D83C][U+DF9A][U+FE0F] Level Progression**
- Level 1: 0 XP required
- Level 2: 100 XP required  
- Level 3: 400 XP required
- Level 4: 900 XP required
- Level 5: 1,600 XP required

### Messaging System Economics

**[U+D83D][U+DCB8] Fee Structure**
```typescript
// Base messaging fee
const baseFee = 0.001; // ETH

// Dynamic fee calculation
const messageFee = baseFee * (1.1 ** messageCount);

// Cooldown period
const cooldownPeriod = 60; // seconds
```

**[U+D83D][U+DEE1][U+FE0F] Anti-Spam Measures**
- Exponential fee increase discourages spam
- Cooldown period prevents rapid messaging
- Permanent on-chain storage ensures message permanence
- Message count tracked per player address

### Territory Control System

**[U+D83D][U+DDFA][U+FE0F] Territory Mechanics**
```typescript
// Control duration
const territoryControlTime = 24 * 60 * 60; // 24 hours in seconds

// Benefits during control period
interface TerritoryBenefits {
  defenseBonus: number; // Battle defense increase
  strategicPosition: boolean; // Map positioning advantage
  allianceCoordination: boolean; // Alliance rally point
  prestigePoints: number; // Reputation system points
}
```

### Alliance System

**[U+D83D][U+DC65] Role-Based Access Control**
```typescript
enum AllianceRole {
  LEADER = 'leader',    // Full control over alliance
  MEMBER = 'member',    // Standard battle and messaging
  INVITED = 'invited'   // Pending acceptance
}

interface AlliancePermissions {
  leader: ['invite', 'kick', 'promote', 'demote', 'dissolve'];
  member: ['battle', 'message', 'leave'];
  invited: ['accept', 'decline'];
}
```
