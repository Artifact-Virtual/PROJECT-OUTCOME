In the evolving digital economy, reliance on the traditional internet infrastructure poses risks. In cases of power outages, cable damage, or grid failures, blockchain networks can endure by finding alternative data transmission routes. This guide provides protocols to maintain transaction flow, even when conventional networks fail.

Mesh Networking

Create a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where devices connect directly to each other. Transactions are passed from device to device like whispers through a crowd. This method is slower but highly effective for moving signed transactions without a central internet connection.

SMS Transactions

Utilize existing cellular towers for basic communication. Transactions can be sent via plain-text SMS, containing a simple command, wallet address, and signature. This method requires no apps or browsers, relying only on a cell signal and a keypad.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://artifact-virtual.gitbook.io/artifact-virtual/home/darknet-continuum\#prtcl3-physical-handshake-ledger)    **PRTCL** **3** `PHYSICAL HANDSHAKE (LEDGER)`

Offline Hardware Transfer

Employ a physical-delivery method for transactions. One person signs a transaction, and another person physically carries the data to a location with an internet connection to broadcast it. This method turns transaction delivery into a form of spycraft.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://artifact-virtual.gitbook.io/artifact-virtual/home/darknet-continuum\#prtcl4-data-relic)    **PRTCL** **4** `DATA RELIC`

USB Sneakernet

Use a portable storage device as the data carrier. A signed transaction file is saved to a USB stick, physically moved to a device that has network access, and then broadcast to the blockchain.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://artifact-virtual.gitbook.io/artifact-virtual/home/darknet-continuum\#prtcl5-static-haul-long-and-short)    **PRTCL** **5** `STATIC HAUL (LONG & SHORT)`

Ham Radio Blockchain

Harness the power of amateur radio. If ham radio can transmit emails over long distances, it can transmit blockchain data, offering a resilient, cross-border method of communication that is immune to physical infrastructure cuts.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://artifact-virtual.gitbook.io/artifact-virtual/home/darknet-continuum\#prtcl6-ghost-mode)    **PRTCL** **6** `GHOST MODE`

Radio Broadcast

Leverage radio broadcasts to transmit transactions. A signed, compressed data packet is converted into radio waves and broadcast over the air. Anyone with the right receiver can capture, decode, and inject the transaction into the network, bypassing routers and DNS entirely.

#### [Direct link to heading](https://artifact-virtual.gitbook.io/artifact-virtual/home/darknet-continuum\#prtcl7-skychain-relay)    **PRTCL** **7** `SKYCHAIN RELAY`

Satellite Link

Broadcast transactions directly into space using a satellite dish. The satellite then relays the data back down to a receiving station connected to the blockchain network, completely bypassing all terrestrial infrastructure.

The true essence of blockchain is independent of the internet; instead, the internet serves as a useful transport layer. If one route fails, a resilient network seeks another path. As long as data can be transferred, value can be transferred.
